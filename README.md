This is my implementation of K-Means Clustering.



Instead of using one from sckitlearn, I implemented my own K-Mean in Python which can be found in the src folder.



The output plots can be found in the images folder.



To create a K-Means cluster of any custom data, simply replace the one I used from the .csv file in the data folder



Like always matplotlib was used for plotting
